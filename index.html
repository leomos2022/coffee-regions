        <h3>A Note on Roasting</h3>
        <p>It may surprise you, but coffee beans aren’t beans at all. Rather, they’re seeds which are grown inside a coffee cherry. Prior to the roasting process these ‘beans’ are green and smell grassy, a far cry from the rich flavour you’ve come to associate with coffee! The roasting process is where the magic happens and the clever little beans develop between 800 – 1000 different aroma compounds to transform into the coffee you know and love.

            It’s during the coffee roasting process that allows for different roast profiles and flavours to be developed and as such, the temperature and time it takes has a huge impact. Quick roasting can result in beans which are dark outside with green inners, which not only tastes bad, but too much chlorogenic acid is produced, a substance that can be unsettling for your stomach. On the other hand, if beans are roasted for too long, it results in a bitter and charred brew.</p>

                    <h5>22&degC (72&degF)</h5>
                    <p>Well-roasted light roast coffee treats you to a gorgeously bright acidity (more on this in a mo). You’ll almost always find fruity, floral flavours. Perhaps a sprightly strawberry sweetness or delicate notes of jasmine?</p>

                <div class="light">
                    <h4>Light Roast</h4>
                    <h5>205&degC (401&degF)</h5>
                    <p>Acidity is one of those things that’s hard to explain. A bit like déjà vu or the taste of water, or the notion of being (if we’re feeling really profound).</p>

                    <h4>City Roast</h4>
                    <h5>219&degC (426&degF)</h5>
                    <p>Coffee beans have a humidity of around 10% (give or take), which means they need to be dried prior to roasting. How long this takes will depend on the roaster in question</p>

                    <p>Vienna roast coffee is dark brown in color, with a bit of oil on the surface and a more bittersweet flavor than beans that roast for a more extended period of time. </p>

            <h2>Brazil</h2>
            <p>Brazil is the world's leading grower and exporter of coffee beans, with a mellow flavor that makes for a very typical dark roast.Generally speaking, the majority of coffee grown in Brazil is common low-altitude, low-grade Arabica - not bad, but unlikely to be considered a premium gourmet coffee.</p>

            <h2>Colombia</h2>
            <p>Colombia is one of the major coffee-producing countries in the world. Coming in 3rd place in production (after Brazil and Vietnam), Colombia has been producing coffee since the plant was introduced to Latin America in the 1700s.

                A unique aspect of Colombia is that the country is mountainous. The Andes mountains cut through the country, roughly north to south, in three parallel mountain ranges. Additionally, there are other mountainous regions such as the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta.</p>

            <h2>India</h2>
            <p>The saga of Indian coffee began on a humble note, with planting of ‘Seven seeds’ of ‘Mocha’ during 1600 AD by the legendary holy saint Baba Budan, in the courtyard of his hermitage on ‘Baba Budan Giris’ in Karnataka. For quite a considerable period, the plants remained as a garden curiosity and spread slowly as back yard plantings.</p>

            <h2>Ethiopia</h2>
            <p>Only Arabica coffee is cultivated in Ethiopia, but the variety of individual cultivars – many as yet growing wild and undiscovered – is unrivalled anywhere in the world. Furthermore, the sheer volume of coffee produced dwarves the output of Kenya and Tanzania at around 450,000 tonnes annually.</p>

            <h2>Costa Rica</h2>
            <p>With near perfect coffee growing conditions all year round, and passionate farmers and government organisations leading the way in innovative cultivation techniques; it is no wonder Costa Rica coffee has a reputation for being some of the best in the world. The Costa Rican people truly take the production of coffee seriously! Their coffee beans can be characterised as balanced, full-bodied, clean and highly aromatic.</p>

            <h2>Kenya</h2>
            <p>Kenyan coffees have a huge range of flavors and nuances depending on the region, varietal and processing methods used. It's a huge country with a wide variety of cultures and customs and has a lot to offer to those who want to dive into separate regions. The best Kenyan coffees can have a full spectrum of flavors to those with a well developed palate.</p>
